    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of <strong><i>The Weather Site</i></strong> is to give current weather conditions
       in 3 different ways.  The initial page will give the weather for the
       current location based on the Geocoding location information from
       the device.  The second is weather for 3 specific locations
       accessible through a dedicated link, and thethird is weather for any location determined by a search string.</p>
    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>Primary audience is adults ages 18-30.  Most will be students. 
         Access to the site will be split between mobile devices and
        laptops.A secondary audience will be anyone interested in weather.</p>
    <h2>Audience Goals:</h2>
      <p>College students move around quite a bit so one goal would be to 
         quickly get the weather conditions for their current location as
         they head off to class or study. They are also often far from
         their homes so the ability to quickly get the conditions for a 
         specific location is important as well.  The third goal deals
         with planning for travels...the ability to get weather conditions
         for any location will help with last minute packing for road trips</p>
        <h2>Persona</h2>
        <img src="images/cool-joe.jpg" alt="snoopy pic">
        <li><strong>Name:: </strong>Joe Cool</li>
        <li><strong>Occupation:</strong>student</li>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong>Eternally 18</li>
        <li><strong>Intrests:</strong>Traveling, Flying, Play acting, Eating</li>
        <li><strong>Motivation:</strong>Joe is not into planning.
              His last minute scrambling, whether it is getting to class
               in the morning or heading out on his latest adventure,
                has left him unprepared for weather conditions many
                 times (He is tired of sleeping in the rain and snow). He would like to be more prepared...withouthaving to put much effort into it...or planning.</li>
        <li><strong>Envionment:</strong>:  Joe is comfortable using 
            laptops and Mobile devices, he will most often be
             found on a smart phone however.  Many of the places he
              frequents do not have
             great signalâ€¦he is often dealing with 3G speeds</li>

             <h2>content</h2>
             <p>All weather pages should include location name, current temperature, forecast high, 
                 forecast low, current weather descriptor, forecast percentage of precipitation,
                  and current wind speed and direction on small devices and hourly temps should
                   be added on larger screens.The pages of the <strong><i>Weather Site</i></strong> will be built in the following order:</p>

             <h3>pages</h3>
             <P><ol>1.	<strong> Franklin and Greenville:</strong> weather for each specific location. The weather for
                 these pages should be pulled from the weather.JSON file that will be provided.</ol>
                <ol> 2.	<strong>Current:</strong> weather for the current location. Current location should be
                     determined by using the Geolocation API of the browser.  This information should be passed
                     to the National Weather Service (NWS) API to retrieve the current conditions.</ol>  
                  <ol> 3.	<strong>Search:</strong> Begins with only a search box, characters
                     entered will cause a list of suggested matches to appear.  Selected location will pull up the weather. </ol> 
                    </P>
