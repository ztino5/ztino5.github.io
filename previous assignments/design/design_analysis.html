    <h1>Design - Analysis Assessment</h1>

    <h2>Design Principles</h2>

    <h3>Proximity —</h3>
    <img class="img" src="images\Proximity.jpg" alt="espn example of proximity">
    <p class ="explanation">ESPN.com makes good use of proximity. The principle of proximity says that like items 
        should be close and visibly separated from unalike items. ESPN does a nice job of grouping 
        similar items together by sport, topic, as well as other criteria. As you can see in this 
        picture, the main method they use to group is the boxes that the groups are contained in. 
        They are subtle. It is a slight color difference from the background, but it helps the mind 
        group like things together in a wonderful way. Alike items are close to each other in the boxes 
        and the boxes provide the break for items that are different. </p>

    <h3>Alignment —</h3>
    <img class="img" src="images\Alignment.JPG" alt="espn example of alignment">
    <p class ="explanation">ESPN.com also does a superb job in applying the principle of alignment. Alignment creates 
        structure and balance in a website. As you can see in the following screenshot, there is 
        a strong left alignment with the logos for the different categories.  This provides a 
        structure for the viewer to know that each time one sees a logo left aligned in that matter, 
        then a new topic is being viewed.  The logo is not the only consistent alignment in the 
        screenshot. The headers for each section and the body text are aligned at the same place. 
        These strong alignments are visually appealing and will help the viewer have a better experience.</p>

    <h3>Repetition —</h3>
    <img class = "img" src="images\Repetition.jpg" alt="espn example of repetition">
    <p class= "explanation">ESPN has a great site that user can use in a mobile browser on phones. Their design is spot on
        and that includes using repetition throughout their mobile site. As seen in the screenshot, they have a red that they 
        use twice near the top. That may not seem like a lot of repetition, but throughout the site, that red is their base color
        that is used in many instances. Also, the same font with a specific weight is used in all the headlines, providing the 
        user with repetition to know that when that font is bolded, they are most likely looking at the title of an article.
        One last bit of repetition that I would like to point out is the repetition in format seen in the screenshot. They use
        rounded boxes to categorize and organize the content. Repetition can be used in many different scenarios, whether it be
        font, organization, or colors and ESPN does a great job of utilizing the benefits of repetition.

    <h3>Contrast —</h3>
    <img class= "img" src="images\Contrast.png" alt="espn example of contrast">
    <p class="explanation">The different levels of contrast presented on the mobile site for ESPN.com are apparent in the top left 
        for the ESPN with a white lettering and a black and red background. The next example is the calls to 
        action buttons in the BUY and Fightcenter, with the Buy with way more contrast to grab you attention 
        the most to get you to try and buy the fight. Also the star in the bottom tells us that there is a 
        custom specification for us to address.</p>

    <h3>Typography —</h3>
    <img class = "img" src="images\Typography.PNG" alt="espn example of typography">
    <p class = "explanation">ESPN.com does a great job at using typography in their website. Typography is the art and technique used 
        to arrange typing. In the screenshot, you can see multiple college softball games that are playing this 
        week. Some of the games have already been finished. By putting the team that lost in gray colored font, 
        it helps users to instantly know that that team has lost their game this week and that the one still colored 
        in black is the one that won. You can also see at the top that NC State and North Carolina are playing right 
        as you are on that website by seeing that “Bot 3rd” is in red font. You can also see this by seeing the watch 
        button right beside it.</p>
