            <p>
                    We need to walk more resolutely and more charitably the path that Jesus has shown. We need to <strong >pause to help and lift another</strong> and surely we will find
                    <strong> beyond [our] own.</strong> If we would do more to <strong> the healer's art,</strong> there would be untold chances to use it, to touch the <strong>wounded and the weary</strong> 
                    and show to all <strong>a gentle[r] heart.</strong> Yes, Lord, we should follow thee.
            </p>
            <p>
                Out of the abundance of his heart,Jesus showed his expressions and examples of unbound charity:

                    Jesus blessed the:

                        <li>
                            drove out the demons and evil spirits

                            purified those burdened with sin

                    The Savior has commanded us to love one another as he has loved us; to clothe ourselves <strong>the bond of charity</strong>  (D&C 88:125), as he so clothed himself. We are called upon to purify our inner feelings, to change our hearts, to make our outward actions and appearance conform to what we say we believe and feel inside. We are to be true disciples of Christ.

            </p>
            <p>
                I add witness that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world, and that this is his church, in the name of Jesus Christ. amen.

        <h3>Bind up their wounds</h3>
         <p>Henry B. Eyring</p>
         <p>
             All of us are blessed with responsibility for others. To hold the priesthood of God is to be held responsible by God for the eternal lives of <strong><i>His</i></strong> children. That is real, that is wonderful, and at times that can feel overwhelming.
         </p>
         <p>
             You and the priesthood beares you are called to lead can have at least three assurances.
         </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                First, the Lord will give you, if you ask, the feelings of compassion He feels for those in need.
            </li>
            <li>
                Second, He will provide others, like the innkeeper, to join with you in your service.
            </li>
            <li>
                And third, the Lord, like the good Samaritan, will more than recompenses all who join in giving help to those in need.
            </li>

        </ol>
        <p>
            You cannot know all yur quorum members perfectly well, but God does. So, as you have done so many times, you prayed to know whom to ask to help serve others. The Lord knows who will be blessed by being asked to help and whoes family will be blessed by not being asked. That is the relevation you can expect to come to you as you lead in the priesthood.
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                Wherefore, my beloved breathern, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followeres of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like,him for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; tha we may be purified even as he is pure.
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            I pray that we may prepare ourselves to give whatever priesthood service the Lord may set before us on our mortal journey. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.

        <h3>Bind up their wounds</h3>
         <p>Linda Burton</p>
         <p>
             One of the greatest evidences we have that our beloved prophet. President Thomas S Monson, is the Lord's chosen servant is that he has learned to follow the Savior's example-serving individually,one by one. Those of us who have entered the waters of baptism have covenanted to do the same. We have covenanted to <strong>"always remember [the Savior] and keep his commmandments,"</strong> and He has said,<strong>"This is my commandment, That ye love one another,as I have loved you."</strong> 
         </p>
         <ul>
             

                 We are all invited to follow Jesus's teachings and to minister to others. This invitation is not limited to angelic sisters.
            
         </ul>
         <p>
             President Monson has reminded us that charity, <strong>"the pure love of Christ</strong>-or in other words,observing and serving-<strong>"is evident when an elderly widow is remembered and taken to ward functions"</strong>and <strong>"when the sister sitting alone in Relief Society recieves the invitation, 'Come-sit by us.'"</strong> The golden rule is applicable here: <strong>"Whatsoever ye would that men [or women] should do to you, do ye even so to them."</strong>
         </p>
         <p>
             May we all seek to <strong><i>first</i></strong> observe
